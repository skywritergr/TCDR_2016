# The REN stack
We like acronyms in JavaScript so I decided to create one (apologies if someone used it before me). Lo and behold the REN stack. 

It uses:
* ReactJS for the front end
* ExpressJS for server middleware
* NodeJS as the backend.
* Webpack for compiling the JSX to JS.

This is a very simple boilerplate just to get you started. All the webpack configuration is done for you and also I have created a couple of files to showcase how to split your ccode/modules into different files. Hope you find it useful.

## Installation
Simply clone the repository and run **npm install**

## Start developing
Just run **gulp** and gulp will start the server, compile the files and will monitor for any changes in the server or your JS files. You don't need to start/stop the server manually.
